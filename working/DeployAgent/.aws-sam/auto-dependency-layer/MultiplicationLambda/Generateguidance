// ["MultiplicationLambda", "Guidance"]    
To access the lambda function, you'll need to make an HTTP POST request using Axios. This request should be sent to the URL specified by the `VITE_MultiplicationLambda` environment variable, appended with the path `/MultiplicationLambda`. The body of the request should be a JSON object containing two properties: `multiplier` and `multiplicand`, both of which should be numbers. The lambda function will process this input and return the product of these two values.

Here's the JSON payload example you'll need to send with your POST request:

```json
{
  "multiplier": 5,
  "multiplicand": 10
}
```

And here's the Axios code example for making the POST request to the lambda function:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual environment variable value if not set up to be replaced during build
const lambdaUrl = process.env.VITE_MultiplicationLambda + '/MultiplicationLambda';

// The payload should contain the 'multiplier' and 'multiplicand' properties
const payload = {
  multiplier: 5,
  multiplicand: 10
};

// Making a POST request using Axios
axios.post(lambdaUrl, payload)
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response from the lambda function here
    console.log('The product is:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors here
    console.error('Error calling the lambda function:', error);
  });
```

Remember to handle both the success and error cases appropriately in your application. The `.then()` block will process the successful response, while the `.catch()` block will handle any errors that occur during the request.
